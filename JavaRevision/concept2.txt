static keyword
static is only related to class and not objects.
It indicates that the particular member belongs to itself, rather than an instance of
that type. It is mainly used to help memory management.
The keyword can be applied to variables, methoda, blocks and nested class.

Static keeps the value unchanged for all objects.

Like for class Person(){
    String name;
    static String planet;
} with objects person1, person2..so on
the name cannot be static becoz each person may have diff name.
But the planet can be static as all persons are on same planet Earth.

Parent must be static if child is declared static.
Top-level class cannot be static, but nested class can be.

Importance of static in nested class.
Consider class A with 2 more class B and class C.
class C is static class while class B is not.
For us to create an object of class B we need to create object of class A.
For us to create an object of class C we don't need to create an object of class A.
We can say B is tightly coupled with A while C isn't.

static-blocks: These blocks of code execute before the main function.
We can create static blocks just like this:
static {
    //Your code here
}
