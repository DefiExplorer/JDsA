Final Keyword:

-> A final variable cannot be changed.
-> A final method cannot be overridden.
-> A final class cannot be extended, no further child class is possible.
...
Final Keyword can only be initialised once, and it is must to do so otherwise
compile time error occurs.
Final variable must be all Capital for good practice.
Final variable which isn't initialised is called Blank final while declaration, but always initialise
it before use.
In case of reference final variable, the internal state of the object pointed by that reference variable can be changed.
class Student{
    String name;
    int age;
}
suppose: -
Student n1 = new Student();
Student n2 = new Student();
final Student n3 = new Student();
final Student n4 = new Student();

n1 = n2;//No error_reference change
n3 = n2;//Compiler error

n4.name="Rahul";//Internal state change possible.
