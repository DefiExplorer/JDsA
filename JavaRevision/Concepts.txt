/*Encapsulation:
Process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit. The data in a class is hidden from
other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.
*/
//Access Modifiers and Package
/*Java package is group of similar type of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.
There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io,
util, sql etc.

Access modifiers provides way to give access to program. These are->

Public: From anywhere.
Private: Only within the class.
Protected: Only within the package, outside the package only through the child class.
Default: Only within the package, cannot be accessed from outside the package in any way.
        This is by default access modifier if others are not used.

Suppose:
Movies-->
        Types-->
                Bollywood
                Hollywood
                Anime
                        --> Action
                            Romance
                            Drama
                            Haunted
To access any package we just do:

package Movies.Types.Bollywood

Suppose the above packages consists of classes of various genre, then to use
that class in other class, we do:

import Movies.Types.Bollywood.Romance;

If we need to use all genre, then:

import Movies.Types.Bollywood.*;

*/
To achieve Encapsulation: -
1. Declare the variables of a class as Private
2. Provide public setter and getter methods that will be used to write and read variables values.
